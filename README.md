# SAP ABAP Employee Management Project

## About the Project

This is a beginner-level SAP ABAP project created as part of my learning journey into SAP development. The main goal was to understand how backend data is handled inside SAP using ABAP, and how to build a simple business-style report similar to real enterprise scenarios.

The project simulates a basic employee management system where employee data is stored in a custom table and displayed using an ALV report.

## What I Practiced

- Creating custom tables using SAP Data Dictionary (SE11)
- Writing ABAP reports using SELECT queries
- Working with internal tables and work areas
- Displaying data using ALV (CL_SALV_TABLE)
- Using selection screen parameters for filtering
- Basic understanding of SAP Gateway and OData services

## Project Components

- Custom table: ZEMPLOYEE_MASTER
- ABAP report program to fetch and display employee data
- ALV output for structured display
- Basic OData service setup (learning purpose)

## SAP Transactions Used

- SE11 – Table creation
- SE38 – ABAP report programming
- SEGW – OData service builder
- /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE – Service activation

## Future Improvements

- Add create/update/delete functionality
- Improve UI using SAP Fiori
- Add advanced filtering and validation
